I am invited for a talk at the <a href='https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/research/groups/low-carbon-energy-and-resources-technologies-research-group/international-conference-of-net-zero-carbon-built-environment.aspx'>1st International Conference of Net Zero Carbon Built Environment</a>. My talk would cover potential applications of sky images for smart building modeling.
