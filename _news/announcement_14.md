I am invited for a talk at the Energy Visions Seminar hosted by <a href='https://aeii.applied-energy.org/energy-visions'>Applied Energy Innovation Institute</a>. My talk would cover the topic of Synthetic Sky Images from Generative Models for Probabilistic Solar Forecasting. This talk is based on the <a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adapen.2024.100172'>paper</a> we recently published in Advances in Applied Energy.
