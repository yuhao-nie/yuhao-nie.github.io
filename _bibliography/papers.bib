  abstract={Sky-image-based solar forecasting using deep learning has been recognized as a promising approach in reducing the uncertainty in solar power generation. However, one of the biggest challenges is the lack of massive and diversified sky image samples. In this study, we present a comprehensive survey of open-source ground-based sky image datasets for very short-term solar forecasting (i.e., forecasting horizon less than 30 minutes), as well as related research areas which can potentially help improve solar forecasting methods, including cloud segmentation, cloud classification and cloud motion prediction. We first identify 72 open-source sky image datasets that satisfy the needs of machine/deep learning. Then a database of information about various aspects of the identified datasets is constructed. To evaluate each surveyed datasets, we further develop a multi-criteria ranking system based on 8 dimensions of the datasets which could have important impacts on usage of the data. Finally, we provide insights on the usage of these datasets for different applications. We hope this paper can provide an overview for researchers who are looking for datasets for very short-term solar forecasting and related areas.},

  abstract={Solar forecasting from ground-based sky images has shown great promise in reducing the uncertainty in solar power generation. With more and more sky image datasets open sourced in recent years, the development of accurate and reliable deep learning-based solar forecasting methods has seen a huge growth in potential. In this study, we explore three different training strategies for solar forecasting models by leveraging three heterogeneous datasets collected globally with different climate patterns. Specifically, we compare the performance of local models trained individually based on single datasets and global models trained jointly based on the fusion of multiple datasets, and further examine the knowledge transfer from pre-trained solar forecasting models to a new dataset of interest. The results suggest that the local models work well when deployed locally, but significant errors are observed when applied offsite. The global model can adapt well to individual locations at the cost of a potential increase in training efforts. Pre-training models on a large and diversified source dataset and transferring to a target dataset generally achieves superior performance over the other two strategies. With 80% less training data, it can achieve comparable performance as the local baseline trained using the entire dataset.},

  abstract={Large-scale integration of photovoltaics (PV) into electricity grids is challenged by the intermittent nature of solar power. Sky-image-based solar forecasting using deep learning has been recognized as a promising approach to predicting the short-term fluctuations. However, there are few publicly available standardized benchmark datasets for image-based solar forecasting, which limits the comparison of different forecasting models and the exploration of forecasting methods. To fill these gaps, we introduce SKIPP'D -- a SKy Images and Photovoltaic Power Generation Dataset. The dataset contains three years (2017-2019) of quality-controlled down-sampled sky images and PV power generation data that is ready-to-use for short-term solar forecasting using deep learning. In addition, to support the flexibility in research, we provide the high resolution, high frequency sky images and PV power generation data as well as the concurrent sky video footage. We also include a code base containing data processing scripts and baseline model implementations for researchers to reproduce our previous work and accelerate their research in solar forecasting.},

  abstract={Integrating photovoltaics (PV) into electricity grids is challenged by potentially large fluctuations in power generation. In recent years, sky image-based PV output prediction using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has emerged as a promising approach to forecasting fluctuations. A key challenge is imbalanced sky image datasets: because of the geography of solar PV system installations, sky image datasets are often rich in sunny condition data but deficient in cloudy condition data. This imbalance contrasts with the fact that model errors are dominated by cloudy condition performance. In this study, we attempt to remedy this by exploring the enrichment and augmentation of an imbalanced sky images dataset for two PV output prediction tasks: nowcasting (predicting concurrent PV output) and forecasting (predicting 15-minute-ahead future PV output). We empirically examine the efficacy of using different resampling and data augmentation approaches to create a rebalanced dataset for model development. A three-stage greedy search is used to determine the optimal resampling approach, data augmentation techniques and over-sampling rate. The results show that for the nowcast problem, resampling and data augmentation can effectively enhance the model performance, reducing overall root mean squared error (RMSE) by an average of 4%, or a 15 std. (standard deviation) of improvement compared to the variability of the baseline model. In contrast, the treatment RMSE for the forecast problem nearly always overlaps the baseline performance at the ± 2 std. level. The optimal resampling approach expands on the original dataset by over-sampling the minority cloudy data, with the best results from large over-sampling rate (e.g., 4 ~ 6 times over-sampling of cloudy images).},

  abstract={Natural gas (NG) produced in Western Canada is a major and growing source of Canada’s energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions portfolio. Despite recent progress, there is still only limited understanding of the sources and drivers of Western Canadian greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We conduct a case study of a production facility based on Seven Generation Energy Ltd.’s Western Canadian operations and an upstream NG emissions intensity model. The case study upstream emissions intensity is estimated to be 3.1–4.0 gCO2e/MJ NG compared to current best estimates of British Columbia (BC) emissions intensities of 6.2–12 gCO2e/MJ NG and a US average estimate of 15 gCO2e/MJ. The analysis reveals that compared to US studies, public GHG emissions data for Western Canada is insufficient as current public data satisfies only 50% of typical LCA model inputs. Company provided data closes most of these gaps (∼80% of the model inputs). We recommend more detailed data collection and presentation of government reported data such as a breakdown of vented and fugitive methane emissions by source. We propose a data collection template to facilitate improved GHG emissions intensity estimates and insight about potential mitigation strategies.},

  abstract={Photovoltaics (PV), the primary use of solar energy, is growing rapidly. However, the variable output of PV under changing weather conditions may hinder the large-scale deployment of PV. In this study, we propose a two-stage classification-prediction framework to predict contemporaneous PV power output from sky images (a so-called “nowcast”), and compare it with an end-to-end convolution neural network (CNN). The proposed framework first classifies input images into different sky conditions and then the classified images are sent to specific sub-models for PV output prediction. Two types of classifiers are developed and compared: (1) a CNN-based classifier trained on clear sky index (CSI)-labeled sky images and (2) a physics-based non-parametric classifier based on a threshold of fractional cloudiness of sky images. Different numbers of classification categories are also examined. The results suggest that the cloudiness-based classifier is more suitable than the CSI-based classifier for the framework, and the 3-class classification (i.e., sunny, cloudy, overcast) is found to be the optimal choice. We then fine-tune the cloudiness threshold for the non-parametric classifier and tailor the architecture for each sky-condition-specific sub-model. Under the best design, the proposed framework can achieve a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 2.20 kW (relative to a 30 kW rated PV array) on the test set comprising 18 complete days (9 sunny, RMSE = 0.69 kW; 9 cloudy, RMSE = 3.06 kW). Compared with the end-to-end CNN baseline model, the overall prediction performance can be improved by 6% (7% in sunny and 6% in cloudy), with 6% fewer trainable parameters needed in the architecture.},

  abstract={Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is a promising alternative to coal to mitigate the greenhouse gas (GHG) and particulate emissions from power, industry, and district heating in China. While numerous existing life cycle assessment (LCA) studies estimate the GHG footprint of LNG, large variation exists in these results. Such variability could be caused by differing project designs, system boundaries, modeling methods and data sources. It is not clear which of these factors is the most important. Here, three research groups from Canada and the US performed independent LCAs of the same planned LNG supply chain from Canada to China. The teams applied different methods and assumptions but used aligned system boundaries and worked with a single upstream producer to obtain production data. The GHG emissions of Canadian LNG to China for power and heat generation were found to be 427–556 g CO2-eq/kWh and 81–92 g CO2-eq/MJ. Compared with Chinese coal for power generation, 291–687 g CO2-eq (34%–62%) reduction can be achieved per kWh of power generated. The central tendency in each study is aligned more closely than the overall uncertainty range: thus, uncertainty caused by fundamental data challenges likely outweighs variability caused by use of different LCA methods. Differences in assumptions and methods among the three teams lead to moderate variation at the stage level, but in better agreement at the life-cycle level, showing the existence of compensating variation. Given the robustness to very different LCA methods, existing literature variation may be explained by project-, location- and operator-dependent parameters.},

  abstract={Reducing methane emissions from the oil and gas industry is a critical climate action policy tool in Canada and the US. Optical gas imaging-based leak detection and repair (LDAR) surveys are commonly used to address fugitive methane emissions or leaks. Despite widespread use, there is little empirical measurement of the effectiveness of LDAR programs at reducing long-term leakage, especially over the scale of months to years. In this study, we measure the effectiveness of LDAR surveys by quantifying emissions at 36 unconventional liquids-rich natural gas facilities in Alberta, Canada. A representative subset of these 36 facilities were visited twice by the same detection team: an initial survey and a post-repair re-survey occurring ∼0.5–2 years after the initial survey. Overall, total emissions reduced by 44% after one LDAR survey, combining a reduction in fugitive emissions of 22% and vented emissions by 47%. Furthermore, >90% of the leaks found in the initial survey were not emitting in the re-survey, suggesting high repair effectiveness. However, fugitive emissions reduced by only 22% because of new leaks that occurred between the surveys. This indicates a need for frequent, effective, and low-cost LDAR surveys to target new leaks. The large reduction in vent emissions is associated with potentially stochastic changes to tank-related emissions, which contributed ∼45% of all emissions. Our data suggest a key role for tank-specific abatement strategies as an effective way to reduce oil and gas methane emissions. Finally, mitigation policies will also benefit from more definitive classification of leaks and vents.},

The optimal locations and capacities of the potential renewable power plants (i.e., solar, wind, biomass, geothermal and hydropower), the phase-out schedule of existing fossil-based (nature gas) power plants and the transmission of electricity across the entire network are determined with the minimal total annualized cost measured by net present value (NPV). The results show that the renewable electricity contribution could increase to 85.9% by 2030 and reach 100% by 2035.

Three scenarios were investigated to understand how supply chain designs could influence the system's economic performance. The minimum selling price (MSP) of HTL biofuels was found to be 63%–80% higher than that of petroleum fuels. Converting forest residues to bio-oil and wood pellet before being transported to the conversion facility can lower the variable operating cost but not the MSP of HTL biofuels, due to the considerable increase in capital investment. Processing parameters such as the yield of bio-oil and biofuel can significantly influence the MSP of HTL biofuels, therefore, technology advancement can make great contribution in reducing the production cost. Alternatively, a high carbon tax is needed to make the HTL biofuels competitive with petroleum fuels.},

  abstract={Wind turbines transform wind energy into electricity and it has a negative environmental impact during manufacturing or transportation. Gearbox is one of the most important components of wind turbine and its reliability is of great concern in industry. So this study performed a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to evaluate the environmental impact of wind turbine gearbox considering its reliability, with a “cradle-to-grave” approach. To quantify the influence of wind turbine gearbox's reliability on its environmental impact and provide a more realistic and accurate result, reliability analysis was integrated into LCA model. The reliability of gearbox determines not only the required amount of gearbox to achieve its design life but also the number of components which can be reused in next gearbox, both of which affect the environmental performance. First, the method to calculate these two parameters was described, afterwards, these two parameters would be used in the LCA model. Then, a 2 MW wind turbine gearbox with two recycling scenarios was used as the case study. The results show that the life cycle assessment of the gearbox is dominated by the manufacture process, and the reuse of components can reduce the impact around 10%. The reliability sensitivity analysis indicates that the environmental impact increases 25.25% as gearbox's reliability is reduced from 78.25% to 40.03%. Therefore, by taking reliability information into consideration when evaluating its environmental impact, a more accurate and realistic assessment result can be achieved.},
