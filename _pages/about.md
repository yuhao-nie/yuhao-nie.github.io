I am now a PhD Candidate in <a href='https://earth.stanford.edu/ere#gs.8zgh6z'>Energy Science & Engineering</a> at <a href='https://www.stanford.edu/'>Stanford University</a>, advised by Professor <a href='https://profiles.stanford.edu/adam-brandt'>Adam Brandt</a>.
Before that, I obtained my Master's degree in <a href='https://chbe.ubc.ca/'>Chemical Engineering</a> from <a href='https://www.ubc.ca/'>University of British Columbia (UBC)</a>, where I worked with Professor <a href='https://chbe.ubc.ca/xiaotao-bi/'>Xiaotao Tony Bi</a>.

My research interests lie at the intersection of <strong>energy</strong>, <strong>environment</strong>, and <strong>data science</strong>. 
More specifically, I develop assessment tools, optimization models and machine learning systems to help solve challenges in transition to sustainable energy systems.
My current research mainly focuses on short-term solar forecasting from sky images to reduce the uncertainty in photovoltaic power generation.
