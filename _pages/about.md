I am a Michael Hammer Postdoctoral Fellow at MIT <a href='https://idss.mit.edu/'>Institute for Data, System, and Society</a>. I am also part of the <a href='https://lids.mit.edu/'>Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems</a> and the <a href='https://earthintelligence.mit.edu/'>Earth Intelligence Lab</a>.

Previously, I received my Ph.D. in Energy Science and Engineering from Stanford University in 2023 and my M.A.Sc in Chemical Engineering from the University of British Columbia in 2018. I obtained my B.Eng. in Environmental Engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology in 2015.

My research lies at the interface of **energy systems**, **sustainability**, and **artificial intelligence**. I use novel data and computational algorithms to study the interplay between energy and the environment. Specifically, I focus on understanding

- **how environmnetal factors, particularly weather and climate, influence energy systems**. This line of research leverages **multimodal data** (e.g., remote sensing imagery, weather and climate observations) and advanced **machine learning** methods to assess renewable resource availability, forecast energy generation, and further optimize the design and operation of more reliable and resilient energy systems.

- **how energy systems, in turn, impact the environment.** This research thread combines **system modeling** with **life cycle analysis** to quantify the environmental and socioeconomic impacts of emerging energy technologies and services. It also employs **remote sensing** and **machine learning** to monitor the energy transition, e.g., mapping energy facilities, tracking energy emissions, to ensure that energy deployments align with sustainable development goals.
