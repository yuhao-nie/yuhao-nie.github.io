I am a Michael Hammer Postdoc Fellow at <a href='https://idss.mit.edu/'>MIT Institute for Data, Systems, and Society</a>, working with Professor <a href='https://sherriewang.github.io/'>Sherrie Wang</a> on remote sensing and machine learning for applications in agriculture and energy. My research interest also lies in developing machine learning systems, assessment tools and optimization models to address challenges in transition to sustainable energy systems.

Previously, I received my Ph.D. in Energy Science and Engineering from Stanford University, advised by Professor <a href='https://profiles.stanford.edu/adam-brandt'>Adam Brandt</a>, and my M.A.Sc in Chemical Engineering from University of British Columbia (UBC), under the guidance of Professor <a href='https://chbe.ubc.ca/xiaotao-bi/'>Xiaotao Tony Bi</a>. I obtained my B.Eng. in Environmental Engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT).
