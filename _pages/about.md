My research interests lie at the intersection of <strong>energy</strong>, <strong>environment</strong>, and <strong>data science</strong>. 
More specifically, I develop assessment tools, optimization models and machine learning systems to help solve challenges in transition to sustainable energy systems.
My recent research mainly focuses on short-term solar forecasting from sky images using deep learning to reduce the uncertainty in photovoltaic power generation.
